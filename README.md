# Machine Learning

This repo includes a collection of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, all in python, and leveraging Open Source packages like [scikitlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).  
The goal of this repo is to familiarize ourselves with these algorithms, applied to various data sets and use cases and see if there are good candidates to onboard into our projects or platform(s).

To note I am also capturing additional notebooks that leverage Amazon SageMaker and their own improved implementation of some of these algorithms in this [aws-sagemaker-notebooks](https://github.com/FabG/aws-sagemaker-notebooks) repo.

### 1. Installation & How to Run
It is highly recommended to utilize a virtual environment like [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) due to this project having several libraries to import.
Also please use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (and not python 2.X)

Install the python packages (after setting up your virtual environment):
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


Finally, you will need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to run the notebooks:
 - Jupyter Lab install (recommended): `pip install jupyterlab`
 - Classic Jupyter Notebook install: `pip install notebook`

Once installed, run:
 - Jupyter Lab: `jupyter-lab`
 - or Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`


### 2. Collection of Notebooks showcasing different ML algorithms

#### 2.1 Supervised algorithms
##### 2.1.1 SVM (Support vector machines)
###### SVM Intro
[SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for **classification**, **regression** and **outliers detection**.

The **advantages** of support vector machines are:
- Effective in high dimensional spaces.
- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.
- Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

The **disadvantages** of support vector machines include:
- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.
- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).
